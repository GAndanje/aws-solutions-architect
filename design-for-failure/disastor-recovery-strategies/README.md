# Disaster Recovery Strategies on AWS

This repository covers various disaster recovery (DR) strategies that can be implemented using AWS. Disaster recovery is critical for ensuring business continuity by recovering workloads in the event of a failure or disaster. Below are four common DR strategies, each with a different balance of cost, recovery time, and complexity.

## 1. Backup & Restore

### Overview
Backup & Restore is the simplest and most cost-effective disaster recovery strategy. Data and application backups are regularly taken and stored in a secure location. In the event of a disaster, the system is restored from these backups.

### Key Components
- **S3**: Used for storing backups (data, database snapshots, etc.).
- **AWS Backup**: Automates and centralizes the backup of AWS services.
- **RDS Snapshots**: For database backups.
- **EC2 AMIs**: For backing up EC2 instances.

### Recovery Process
1. Retrieve data and system backups from S3 or RDS snapshots.
2. Restore EC2 instances, databases, and any other infrastructure components.
3. Reconfigure and redeploy the application.

### Use Case
- Suitable for non-critical workloads where downtime is acceptable, as recovery can take several hours.
  
### Recovery Time Objective (RTO): Hours
### Recovery Point Objective (RPO): Hours

## 2. Pilot Light

### Overview
In a Pilot Light strategy, a minimal version of the critical system components is always running in the cloud. In case of a disaster, the full system can be quickly scaled up from this minimal setup.

### Key Components
- **Minimal EC2 instances**: Pre-configured but running at minimal capacity.
- **RDS in read-only mode**: Keeping the latest data synced.
- **Elastic Load Balancer**: To handle traffic during recovery.
- **Auto Scaling**: To scale up the resources on-demand.

### Recovery Process
1. Spin up additional EC2 instances from pre-configured AMIs.
2. Restore database and sync with the primary instance.
3. Scale up the infrastructure to handle production workloads.

### Use Case
- Suitable for critical systems that need faster recovery times than Backup & Restore, but where cost is still a consideration.

### RTO: Minutes to Hours
### RPO: Minutes to Hours

## 3. Warm Standby

### Overview
Warm Standby involves running a scaled-down version of a fully functional system in another AWS region. During a disaster, the system is scaled up to handle full production load.

### Key Components
- **EC2 instances running at reduced capacity**: Pre-configured with the necessary applications.
- **RDS with active replication**: For keeping data in sync.
- **Elastic Load Balancer**: Redirects traffic once the system is scaled up.
- **Route 53**: For DNS-based failover to the standby environment.

### Recovery Process
1. Increase EC2 instance size and number using Auto Scaling.
2. Restore database connections and sync any remaining data.
3. Shift traffic to the warm standby system.

### Use Case
- Ideal for systems that require faster recovery times than Pilot Light and can tolerate some downtime.

### RTO: Minutes
### RPO: Seconds to Minutes

## 4. Multi-Site (Active-Active)

### Overview
In a Multi-Site Active-Active strategy, your workload runs simultaneously in two or more AWS regions. This provides the highest availability and resilience by distributing traffic across multiple sites.

### Key Components
- **EC2 instances running full production load** in multiple regions.
- **RDS with cross-region replication**: Ensuring database consistency.
- **Route 53**: For global load balancing and routing traffic to healthy regions.
- **Elastic Load Balancer**: Manages traffic distribution across regions.

### Recovery Process
1. No manual intervention required. Traffic is automatically routed to the healthy region in case of failure.
2. Databases are already synchronized across regions, so no data recovery is needed.
  
### Use Case
- Ideal for mission-critical systems where downtime is unacceptable and zero data loss is a requirement.

### RTO: Real-Time Failover
### RPO: Zero to Seconds

## Choosing the Right Strategy

When selecting a disaster recovery strategy, it's essential to balance **cost**, **recovery time** (RTO), and **data loss tolerance** (RPO). Each of these strategies is designed to address different business requirements:

- **Backup & Restore**: For non-critical systems with low cost but higher recovery times.
- **Pilot Light**: For critical systems that need to be recoverable with minimal cost.
- **Warm Standby**: For systems that need quick recovery but can tolerate some minimal downtime.
- **Multi-Site Active-Active**: For mission-critical systems that require real-time failover and no downtime.
